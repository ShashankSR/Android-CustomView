Due to extremely limited time schedule I couldn't complete the functionality as given in the requirement.
The current implementation has a custom view to handle input as given in the requirement. I used 0 in place
of X and 1 in place of the space, as the character width didn't match as expected. It would require further
study on my part, to match the place holder and input text character widths, which would take up more time 
than i can commit to.   

The further steps / commits that needed to be done are as follows

[] Change background and text colors
[] Add icon on the top left
[] Add credit card validator utils
[] Add card validity check
[] Add card type check
[] Add icons for cards
[] Add lifecycle owner into the view
[] Code clean up as necessary
[] Handle character spacing in the view ( Will take some time)
[] Add space after 4 digits for both placeholder and input text
