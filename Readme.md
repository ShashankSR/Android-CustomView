Please find the app-debug.apk in the root directory of the project.
The app has the following functionalities
    - 'X' as the placeholder to be entered
    - Logo shown on the top right corner
    - Invalid text shown on invalid card
    - Does basic validation and type checking
    
The project uses view-model and data-binding. The reason to not put business logic in the view is to 
make the view as extendable as possible. In future the same view can be used for custom OTP input
or specific messages etc.
